Repository to store source to teach Junior High Kids html / css

The thought process is to utilize codepen.io pens with lesson plans to teach kids grade 6th - 8th how to design static websites utilizing html, css, and javascript.

Futher plans include teaching how to use responsive web design frameworks like Bootstrap or Foundation to more quickly develop complete websites, incorporating back-end services or API's for data, or designing completely functional websites from scratch emulating a popular look and feel to a website that kids are already familiar with.
